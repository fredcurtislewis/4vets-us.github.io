## Kitt 

### Strength
**7 rounds:**  
1 front squat  
2 shoulders to overhead  
2 front squat

### WOD
**AMRAP in 14 min**  
30 double unders (2/1)  
hang power snatch, 75 lbs  
3 muscle ups (chest to bar pull-ups)

---
### Notes
complex final weight: 215 lbs. The S2O is the limiting factor - used push jerks and my shoulders were barely there the last two rounds  
WOD: 6 rounds, flat. Can't do more than 2 DUs in a row, so I opted for 60 single-unders. Pull-ups were scaled as descents from jumping chest-to-bar pull-ups.
