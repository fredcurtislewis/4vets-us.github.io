## Kitt 

**row 5000m**

time: 20:53.8

### Notes  
A friend came into town and my diet went out the window. We both felt like we had to hit the gym this morning to sweat off some of the weekend. Today's row was much harder than it should have been, but once I relaxed and realized I wasn't rowing for time I got into a rhythm and was able to get a good sweat going. Walked another mile after to cool down.
