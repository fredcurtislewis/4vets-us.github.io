### Notes
This was supposed to be a 400m run with a medicine ball, but I have three pins in my hip and I don't run so well anymore. The weight vest was easy at first, but I began to notice it around the end of round 2 and it just got more fun from there. Thankfully my gym does [ROMWOD](http://www.romwod.com) on Thursdays after our WOD, so I got some good stretching in.
