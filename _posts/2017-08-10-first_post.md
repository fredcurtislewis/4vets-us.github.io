Motivation is important to maintaining a fitness plan. When I was in college, I was on a sports team and we had scheduled workouts. When I was in the military, we worked out at least once a day, sometimes more, as a group. Now that I'm out of the military and my undergrad days are decades behind me, I need a group to help me get back into shape and stay there.

4Vets is a virtual organization - our team lives all over the country - so we text, chat, and message each other when we need to communicate. We've decided to use this blog as another tool in our toolbox to help keep each other accountable.

We plan to post our daily workouts here when we get the chance.
