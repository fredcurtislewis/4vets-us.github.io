    <p>Motivation is important to maintaining a fitness plan. When I was in college, I was on a sports team and we had scheduled workouts. When I was in the military, we worked out at least once a day, sometimes more, as a group. Now that I’m out of the military and my undergrad days are decades behind me, I need a group to help me get back into shape and stay there.</p>
    <p>4Vets is a virtual organization - our team lives all over the country - so we text, chat, and message each other when we need to communicate. We’ve decided to use this blog as another tool in our toolbox to help keep each other accountable.</p>
    <p>We plan to post our daily workouts here when we get the chance.</p>
